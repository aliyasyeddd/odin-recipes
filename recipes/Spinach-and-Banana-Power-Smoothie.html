    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A vegan banana spinach smoothie that is quick, easy, and surprisingly
      delicious. I make one of these tasty treats for myself every morning for
      breakfast, and it powers me all the way until lunch. I love the mild
      sweetness of the banana, but if you want it sweeter you could add sugar.
      I've also added different flavors like ginger, cinnamon, apple, or any
      number of ingredients. Raw vegans can substitute raw almond milk for the
      soy. Feel free to experiment with different versions, and enjoy the pure
      energy that comes from eating fresh, good-for-you food!
